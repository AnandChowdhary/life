From the stories behind police shootings caught on video, to visiting a town ravaged by the opioid epidemic; from the class-and-race dialogues buried inside the World Cup to living alongside NRA evangelists, we take a topic and inhabit it to explore what's been sealed off, undisclosed, or never brought to life - and return with a deeply-reported portrait of why these stories matter. In The Last Cup, our latest season, we face Lionel Messi - one of the world's most prominent soccer stars. The 2022 World Cup marks his last chance secure the coveted trophy – and a last chance for glory in his home country of Argentina. Hosted by Argentine journalist Jasmine Garsd, The Last Cup is much more than a sports story. It's a tale of immigration and race, of capitalism and class, of belonging and identity. A story for anyone who's ever felt like an outsider in their own home.",
